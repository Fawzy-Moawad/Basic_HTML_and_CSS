                                <p> 
                                    Is the capital of Egypt and the city-state Cairo Governorate, and is the country's largest city, home to 10 million people.<br> 
                                    It is also part of the largest urban agglomeration in Africa.<br>
                                    The Arab world and the Middle East: The Greater Cairo metropolitan area, with a population of 21.9 million, is the 12th-largest in the world by population.<br>
                                    Cairo is associated with ancient Egypt, as the Giza pyramid complex and the ancient cities of Memphis and Heliopolis are located in its geographical area.<br>
                                    Located near the Nile Delta,[7][8] the city first developed as Fustat, a settlement founded after the Muslim conquest of Egypt in 640 next to an existing ancient Roman fortress, Babylon.<br>
                                    Under the Fatimid dynasty a new city, al-Qāhirah, was founded nearby in 969. It later superseded Fustat as the main urban centre during the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods (12th–16th centuries).<br>
                                    Cairo has long been a centre of the region's political and cultural life, and is titled "the city of a thousand minarets" for its preponderance of Islamic architecture.<br>
                                    Cairo's historic center was awarded World Heritage Site status in 1979.<br>
                                    Cairo is considered a World City with a "Beta +" classification according to GaWC<br>
                                    Today, Cairo has the oldest and largest cinema and music industry in the Arab world, as well as the world's second-oldest institution of higher learning.<br>
                                    Al-Azhar University. Many international media, businesses, and organizations have regional headquarters in the city; the Arab League has had its headquarters in Cairo for most of its existence.

                                    the third-largest city in Egypt by area after Cairo and Alexandria; and fourth-largest city in Africa by population after Kinshasa, Lagos and Cairo.<br>
                                    It is the capital of Giza Governorate with a total population of 4,872,448 in the 2017 census. It is located on the west bank of the Nile opposite central Cairo, and is a part of the Greater Cairo metropolis.<br>
                                    Giza lies less than 30 km (18.64 mi) north of Memphis (Men-nefer, today the village of Mit Rahina), which was the capital city of the unified Egyptian state during the reign of pharaoh Narmer, roughly 3100 BC.<br>
                                    Giza is most famous as the location of the Giza Plateau, the site of some of the most impressive ancient monuments in the world, including a complex of ancient Egyptian royal mortuary and sacred structures, including the Great Sphinx, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and a number of other large pyramids and temples.<br>
                                    Giza has always been a focal point in Egypt's history due to its location close to Memphis, the ancient pharaonic capital of the Old Kingdom.

                                <p>
                                    is the second largest city in Egypt, and the largest city on the Mediterranean coast. Founded in c. 331 BC by Alexander the Great.<br>
                                    Alexandria grew rapidly and became a major centre of Hellenic civilisation, eventually replacing Memphis, in present-day Greater Cairo, as Egypt's capital.<br>
                                    Called the "Bride of the Mediterranean" internationally,[11] Alexandria is a popular tourist destination and an important industrial centre due to its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez.<br>
                                    Alexandria was best known for the Lighthouse of Alexandria (Pharos)<br>
                                    One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World; its Great Library, the largest in the ancient world; and the Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa, one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages.<br>
                                    Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural centre of the ancient Mediterranean for much of the Hellenistic age and late antiquity.<br>
                                    It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world before being eventually overtaken by Rome.<br>
                                    The city was a major centre of early Christianity and was the centre of the Patriarchate of Alexandria, which was one of the major centres of Christianity in the Eastern Roman Empire.<br>
                                    In the modern world, the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria both lay claim to this ancient heritage. By 641, the city had already been largely plundered and lost its significance before re-emerging in the modern era.<br>
                                    From the late 18th century, Alexandria became a major centre of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centres in the world, both because it profited from the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean and Red Seas and the lucrative trade in Egyptian cotton.

                                    Hurghada is a popular holiday destination for Europeans, especially during the winter, and some spend Christmas and New Year there.<br>
                                    Tourist numbers from Russia dropped significantly[citation needed] after the Metrojet Flight 9268 plane crash in November 2015.<br>
                                    Hurghada extends for about 36 kilometres (22 mi) along the coast, but does not reach far into the surrounding desert.<br>
                                    The resort is a destination for Egyptian tourists from Cairo, the Delta and Upper Egypt, as well as package holiday tourists from Europe.<br> 
                                    Hurghada has a population of 248,000 and<b> is divided into:</b>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li> Ahia and El Helal|the northern part</li>
                                    <li>El Dahar (Downtown)|the old town</li>
                                    <li>the city center</li>
                                    <li> Kawsar|the modern part</li>
                                    <li>Mamsha (Village Road)|a pedestrianised street with a length of over 4 km (2.5 mi)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Many of Hurghada's newer hotels, restaurants, and shops are located along El Mamsha. Most of the newest and largest hotel resorts are located in the area between Mamsha and Sahl Hasheesh on El Mamsha.<br>
                                    Beyond Sahl Hasheesh there are the hotels of Makadi Bay. Dahar is the oldest part of the town where the town's traditional bazaar, the post office and the long-distance bus stations (Go Bus and Upper Egypt Bus) are situated.<br> 
                                    The busiest area is Sakala, the "city center" on Sheraton Road, where there are hotels, shops and restaurants.

                                   Sahara el Beyda, the White Desert Protected Area, is a national park in Egypt, first established as a protected area in 2002.<br>
                                   It is located in the Farafra depression, 45 km (28 mi) north of the town of Qsar El Farafra. Part of the park is in the Farafra Oasis (New Valley Governorate).<br>
                                   The park is the site of large white chalk rock formations, created through erosion by wind and sand.<br>
                                   It is also the site of cliffs (at the northern end of the Farafra Depression), sand dunes (part of the Great Sand Sea), as well as Wadi Hennis and oases at Ain El Maqfi and Ain El Wadi.<br>
                                   White Desert National Park covers an area of 3,010 km2 (1,160 sq mi). The highest point in the park is at El Qess Abu Said at 353 m (1,158 ft) above sea level, and the lowest is at Wadi Hennis at 32 m (105 ft).<br>
                                   The park serves as the refuge for various animals, including the endangered Rhim gazelle and the vulnerable Dorcas gazelle, as well as Barbary sheep; jackals; Rüppell's, red and fennec foxes; and the sand cat.

                                   Luxor has frequently been characterized as the "world's greatest open-air museum", as the ruins of the Egyptian temple complexes at Karnak and Luxor stand within the modern city.<br>
                                   Immediately opposite, across the River Nile, lie the monuments, temples and tombs of the west bank Theban Necropolis, which includes the Valley of the Kings and Valley of the Queens.<br>
                                   Thousands of tourists from all around the world arrive annually to visit Luxor's monuments, contributing greatly to the economy of the modern city.

                                <p>
                                   Aswan is a busy market and tourist centre located just north of the Aswan Dam on the east bank of the Nile at the first cataract.<br>
                                   The modern city has expanded and includes the formerly separate community on the island of Elephantine.<br>
                                   Aswan includes five monuments within the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Nubian Monuments from Abu Simbel to Philae (despite Aswan being neither Nubian, nor between Abu Simbel and Philae); these are the Old and Middle Kingdom tombs of Qubbet el-Hawa, the town of Elephantine, the stone quarries and Unfinished Obelisk, the Monastery of St. Simeon and the Fatimid Cemetery.<br>
                                   The city's Nubian Museum is an important archaeological center, containing finds from the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia prior to the Aswan Dam's flooding of all of Lower Nubia.<br>
                                   The city is part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the category of craft and folk art. Aswan joined the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities in 2017.
